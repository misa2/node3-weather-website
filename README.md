# node3-weather-website
An application to show customized weather forecast for an address or place. It accepts the place name, and searches in background for its coordinates. It then uses the location coordinates to fetch local weather forecast and finally shows this forecast in browser.
Based on excellent Node.js course by Andrew Mead
